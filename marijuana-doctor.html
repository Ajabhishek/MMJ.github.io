         <p>Introducing telemedicine in the cannabis industry was an intelligent move to bring the patients closer to the green herb. It allows the patients all across the state to connect to professional cannabis doctors and get the guidance they need. But, it has its disadvantages.</p>
         <p>While telemedicine has reduced the time and effort it needs for a patient to find a doctor, it has also caused a rise in the number of frauds. With the rise in the popularity of telemedicine, many people have started to scam patients in the name of MMJ cards and medical services. These doctors do not have any experience in medical marijuana or the way it is used. They are not board certified and neither do they work from a real clinic. They are in for the money. Getting a 420 evaluation from such a doctor is a waste of your hard earned money. So, you’ve got to be wary of such scams and illegal health professionals. Make sure that the doctor or clinic you are consulting is legit and has the authority to do 420 evaluations and give MMJ recommendations. </p>

         <hr class="heading_line mb-4">
         <p>It’s crucial that you take the time to identify the legitimacy of your marijuana doctor or 420 clinic before going ahead with the consultation. The only disadvantage of online consultations is the risk of scams. But, you can avoid them altogether by looking for a few points before choosing your cannabis doctor. </p>
         <p>One, make sure that the doctor is licensed. Every practicing marijuana doctor in California should have a valid license. You can check the license number of our medical professionals on the official website of California.</p>
         <p>Two, your doctor must have a verifiable address proof. If the address of your doctor on the MMJ card cannot be verified, it will not be accepted anywhere in the state. So, your doctor should work from a real clinic with a physical location and an established history. </p>
         <p>Third, make sure that you talk to a real doctor during consultation. With us, you get to have a face to face online consultation with our doctor so you can ask them questions about the best way to use medical cannabis. Once you can ensure that each of these points are met, you can go ahead and complete your consultation with your cannabis doctor. </p>

         <p>A consultation with a medical marijuana doctor is meant for the doctor to know more about you and vice versa. During the evaluation, not only does the doctor access you but you can also access the knowledge and experience of the doctor during a consultation. </p>
         <p>When it’s their turn to ask questions, be as transparent as you can be. Talk in detail about your medical condition, symptoms and lifestyle. The more detailed you are, the easier it is for the doctor to understand your health condition and your requirements. It’s beneficial for you as the doctor can plan out a more comprehensive treatment to improve your medical condition. Be respectful and listen to the doctor attentively. They are there to help you to the best of their competence. Appreciate their work and be co-operative. And if you have any doubts, you can always clear them out with your doctor. </p>

It’s a great way to figure out where your doctor stands in terms of medical cannabis and its use as a medical aid. You also get a better idea about the experience and knowledge of the medical professional in the field of medical cannabis. All our doctors have years of experience in the field of medical cannabis.

                 Medical cannabis may be a new addition in the world of healthcare but it’s been doing wonders since its discovery. With every new person using this green herb, more benefits of cannabis are unfolding. Presently, there are a dozen different medical conditions and symptoms that cannabis can help relieve. Whether it’s the chronic pain that doesn’t let you sleep or the discomfort of extreme nausea after chemotherapy, cannabis can help with either case. Though the research is still ongoing, the present data concludes cannabis as being an anti-inflammatory, antiemetic, sedative, pain-relieving, neuroprotective and appetite stimulating as well as appetite regulating drug. With such a diverse range of medical properties, cannabis can affect your body in many ways than you can imagine. Using it without supervision may not be the best decision. This is why a doctor’s consultation helps. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                  A medical marijuana doctor has complete knowledge about the medical aspects of cannabis. And having evaluated your medical condition, they have a better idea about how cannabis can help you improve your condition. You can always ask them about the different effects that you can expect with cannabis. They will give you a detailed explanation of the different ways cannabis can benefit your health. This will help you be prepared and have a smoother first experience.

                <p class="">
                  It’s widely known that cannabis has a long list of medical benefits under its belt. It has been associated with relieving the discomfort related to cancer, PTSD, insomnia, anorexia, chronic pain, seizures and anxiety to name a few. But along with all the medical prowess, cannabis also exhibits a different side of the coin. 
                </p>
                <p class="">
                  Every medication has benefits and a few side effects. Cannabis is no different. Along with all the different ways it helps medical patients, there are a few side effects that come along with using medical cannabis. 
                </p>
                <p class="">
                  If you are a regular cannabis consumer, the side effects can vary from the most common ones like red eyes, dry mouth and munchies (increased hunger) to more severe ones like nausea, paranoia, headaches and fatigue. In addition to this, you will experience the inevitable end of cannabis consumption that is tolerance buildup. While it is beneficial for beginners, with continuous use, high tolerance can become a hindrance in achieving the desired effects. Also, cannabis may react with a few medications or other drugs that you might be consuming.
